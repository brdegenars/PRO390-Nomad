1. Get the location of the incident and store it
2. Determine what direction the destination is, in relation to the origin and the incident.
	- Need dest location and incident location (lat/lng) 
3. Choose two semi-random lat/lng points in the direction derived from step 2, within a close proximity to eachother 
	- Do NOT cross the threshold of the origin's lat and lang. (Don't back track)
4. Add new points to waypoints attribute
5. Request new route
6. Request traffic on new route
7. IF traffic response indicates another incident, repeat step one
   ELSE draw new route and display 
   
   
   
1. Make request for new route
2. IF the point of the incident i still in the new route, move randomized points out further
   ELSE Step 4
3. Step 1
4. Get directions from origin to new waypoint
5. Get directions from new waypoint to destination 
6. Request traffic on new route
7. IF new route has an incident, Step 1
   ELSE draw new polyline
   
   
 NOTES:
 
 - Whichever side of the origin's lng the destination is on, is the direction the waypoints should be chosen in
 - The waypoint's lng should be +/- the incidents lng, and its lat should be +/- from the incident in the direction of the destination
 - Use the bounding box from traffic bounds to determine the outside threshold of the waypoints selected 
 - Waypoints always away from the incident, but still in the direction of the destination
